worked on:
---step 1 scraping of webpage to get ingredients and instructions
---did the parser for ingredient and instructions into our dictionary representation
---made some fixes to edge cases for the parser (parts of speech fix, depluralizer, ensuring words weren't repeated, etc.)
---did most of the custom transform to South Asian cuisine and (a little bit of) help w/ debugging to/from vegetarian
---did the output generator to convert modified ingredient objects to our new ingredient strings
---made the user input for url / instruction selection
