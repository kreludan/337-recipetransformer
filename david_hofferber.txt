worked on:
- Extended/re-wrote the non-vege to vege transform Yixing initially made to be more in-depth and modify ingredient/instruction objects instead of pure list format
- wrote all of, and debugged the majority of, the vege to non-vege, healthy to non-healthy, and non-healthy to healthy transforms
- assisted with debugging the South Asian transform
- Assisted with debugging parsing issues, especially things like edge cases that occurred due to NLTK being wonky
- Did majority of transform testing for required transforms
- Drew out and compiled the state architecture pictures and diagrams for presentation
- Made the readme detailing Python version, installation / dependencies, etc
